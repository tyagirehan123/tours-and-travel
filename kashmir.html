    <h1>KASHMIR</h1>
    <p>Jammu and Kashmir[a] was a region formerly administered by India as a state from 1954 to<br> 2019, constituting the southern and southeastern portion of the larger Kashmir region, which<br> has been the subject of a dispute between India, Pakistan and China since the mid-20th century.<br>The underlying region of this state were parts of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir,<br> whose western districts, now known as Azad Kashmir, and northern territories, now known as<br> Gilgit-Baltistan, are administered by Pakistan. The Aksai Chin region in the east, bordering <br>Tibet, has been under Chinese control since 1962.<br>After the Government of India repealed the special status accorded to Jammu and Kashmir<br> under Article 370 of the Indian constitution in 2019, the Parliament of India passed the Jammu<br> and  Kashmir Reorganisation Act, which contained provisions that dissolved the state<br> and reorganised it into two union territories â€“ Jammu and Kashmir in the west and Ladakh <br>in the east, with effect from 31 October 2019. At the time of its dissolution, Jammu and <br>Kashmir was the only state in India with a Muslim-majority population.</p>
